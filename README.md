# [Computational Assessment of Hyperpartisanship in News Titles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06270)
![main result](./main_result.png)

In this study, we conduct a computational analysis to quantify the extent and dynamics of partisanship in news titles. While some aspects are as expected, our study reveals new or nuanced differences between the three media groups. [[PDF](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/31368/33528)]

## Data
The set of 2,200 manually labeled headlines is available, with 2,000 entries in ```training_set.csv``` and 200 in ```testing_set```, both located in ```/data```.
The dataset containing 1.8 million machine labeled headlines is stored in ```/data/headlines_by_year```.
